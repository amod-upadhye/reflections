start notepad++ using : start notepad++ file_name

an easy access to entire history can help you revert some of the unneccessary changes


git log .. shows all the changes done in the directory

git diff ... shows difference between two commit IDs
git diff .. shows difference between working area and staging area if no IDs are input

git reset --hard .. resets all changes in staging directory or working area

git log --stat  ... shows statistics

git log shows the commits in descending order ... new commits on top older commits on bottom

git branch -d <branch_name> .. delete branch
git bash profile .. to setup git bash profile .. (colors / fonts etc.)

git init ... initialize git repository in an existing directory

git status .. shows changes since the last commit

//staging area .. tracks the files to be changed

git branch .. shows all branches
git branch <new-name> .. creates a new branch
git checkout <branch-name> .. switch to a particular branch

git merge <master> <branch_name> .. merges <branch_name> into <master>
git show <commit_id> shows the changes made in that commit
visual representation of the commit history is git log --graph --oneline master 

git remote .. shows if repo has a remote location

Merge Conflicts divided in 3 parts .. <<<Head .. shows your code, == common ancestor ..original code .. >>> master .. somebody else's code
1. Fix COnflict 
2. Remove Git Markings
3. Add File Again .. git add file_name
4. git commit -m "Fixed Conflict"
5. git merge master <branch_name>

To push local repository on GitHub .. create empty repository on GitHub first

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
changes in 1 file might affect the other files in Git repository 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git Log shows the history of all the files and Git Diff can be used to show difference between 2 files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version Control would make me more confident as I know that my changes can be replaced

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
On initializing a repository, the Git metadata is stored in .git folder .. It is required to let git start tracking the changes occuring in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging Area is like a temporary directory which has all the files you need to track. Files are added to it after git add

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add only specific files for that logical change in commit area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
while creating experimental changes or while working on multiple features at once.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It can help to track the various features being developed

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
